# RABBÄ°TMQ - EXAMPLES

This repository contains various example projects I have created using RabbitMQ. Each folder demonstrates a different use case or design pattern with RabbitMQ. Below, you will find brief descriptions of the content in each folder.

## Contents

- [RabbitMQ-Consumer-Exchange](#rabbitmq-consumer-exchange)
- [RabbitMQ-Consumer-TopicExchange](#rabbitmq-consumer-topicexchange)
- [RabbitMQ-MessageDesign](#rabbitmq-messagedesign)
- [RabbitMQ-Publisher-Exchange](#rabbitmq-publisher-exchange)
- [RabbitMQ-MassTransit](#rabbitmq-masstransit)

## RabbitMQ-Consumer-Exchange

This folder demonstrates how to create a message consumer using an exchange in RabbitMQ. An exchange is a component that routes and queues messages.

- **Examples:**
  - Basic Consumer-Exchange configuration
  - Usage of different exchange types (Direct, Fanout, Topic, Headers)

## RabbitMQ-Consumer-TopicExchange

In this folder, you can see how to create a message consumer using a Topic Exchange. Topic Exchange is used for routing messages based on routing keys.

- **Examples:**
  - Routing messages with Topic Exchange
  - Filtering with routing key patterns

## RabbitMQ-MessageDesign

This folder contains examples related to message design and configuration in RabbitMQ. Message design provides information on how messages are created and routed.

- **Examples:**
  - Message formats and content design
  - Message properties and header information

## RabbitMQ-Publisher-Exchange

This folder demonstrates how to create a message publisher using an exchange in RabbitMQ. The publisher sends messages to the exchange.

- **Examples:**
  - Basic Publisher-Exchange configuration
  - Publishing messages with different exchange types

## RabbitMQ-MassTransit

This folder shows examples of integrating RabbitMQ with MassTransit. MassTransit is a .NET library used for working with messaging infrastructures.

- **Examples:**
  - Configuring RabbitMQ with MassTransit
  - Sending and consuming messages
